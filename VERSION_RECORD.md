# Version Record

## v1.12.3

- Date: 2026-04-20
- Branch: `main`
- Title: Author independent smart-irrigation difficulty scripts

### Changes

- replaced the first smart-irrigation difficulty pilot with authored independent script content
- added a distinct `easy` question bank for first-contact learning
- kept `medium` as the standard field-judgment baseline
- added a distinct `hard` question bank focused on multi-variable trade-off reasoning
- added difficulty-specific landing copy and result-summary emphasis for `smart-irrigation`
- updated the smart-irrigation module label to show that it now uses three authored scripts
- bumped asset version to `20260420e` and service worker cache version to `v24`

### Notes

- this is the first module in the project to move from surface difficulty to content difficulty
- future scenes and modules can now be upgraded one by one using the same authored-script model

## v1.12.2

- Date: 2026-04-20
- Branch: `main`
- Title: Add smart-irrigation difficulty pilot

### Changes

- applied the first real `easy / medium / hard` content rollout to the fifth-scene `smart-irrigation` module
- kept the original smart-irrigation content as the `medium` baseline
- generated an `easy` variant with simpler framing, more time, and reduced selectable-option density on applicable question types
- generated a `hard` variant with denser prompt framing and tighter timing on applicable question types
- updated the smart-irrigation module label to show that it now supports three difficulty tiers
- bumped asset version to `20260420d` and service worker cache version to `v23`

### Notes

- this is the first real difficulty-aware content pilot in the project
- other scenes and modules still use the difficulty-routing foundation until their own question-bank tiers are authored

## v1.12.1

- Date: 2026-04-20
- Branch: `main`
- Title: Add difficulty-aware routing foundation

### Changes

- added a formal `difficulty` state to the main game flow
- added landing-page difficulty selection with `easy`, `medium`, and `hard`
- added presenter-side difficulty selection for QR routing
- updated URL handling so scene, module, locked mode, and difficulty can travel together
- updated local leaderboard keys and shared leaderboard event-code handling to separate by difficulty
- bumped asset version to `20260420c` and service worker cache version to `v22`

### Notes

- this is the routing and state foundation only
- dedicated easy / medium / hard question-bank content is still a follow-up implementation step

## v1.12.0

- Date: 2026-04-20
- Branch: `main`
- Title: Expand fifth scene into a full seven-module hub

### Changes

- converted six previously planned fifth-scene modules into playable content:
  - `agri-tech`
  - `farm-energy`
  - `farm-business`
  - `global-market`
  - `farm-esg`
  - `water-governance`
- kept `smart-irrigation` as the existing pilot module inside the same smart-farm master scene
- completed a seven-module smart-agriculture hub under the fifth-scene structure
- aligned the module cards with real landing, question, result, and leaderboard data
- bumped asset version to `20260420b` and service worker cache version to `v21`

### Notes

- this is the first full-content rollout for the fifth-scene module architecture
- presenter module routing remains compatible with the expanded fifth-scene module list

## v1.11.0

- Date: 2026-04-20
- Branch: `main`
- Title: Add fifth-scene module hub and smart irrigation pilot

### Changes

- added a new master scene: `智慧農場全球任務站`
- added module-based scene support to the main game flow
- added two new fifth-scene views in `index.html`:
  - shared intro
  - module selector
- wired the first playable module: `智慧灌溉題組`
- kept six additional smart-agriculture modules visible as planned cards for later expansion
- updated `app.js`, `scene-registry.js`, and `styles.css` to support module-scene rendering
- bumped asset version to `20260420a` and service worker cache version to `v20`

### Notes

- this is the first implementation slice of the fifth-scene architecture
- scenes 1 through 4 remain on the existing linear scene flow
- future work can extend the same structure with direct `module=` routing and additional smart-agriculture modules

## v1.11.1

- Date: 2026-04-20
- Branch: `main`
- Title: Align presenter routing with fifth-scene modules

### Changes

- updated `presenter.html` and `presenter.js` to support module selection for module-based scenes
- added direct QR generation for `?scene=...&module=...` style fifth-scene URLs
- aligned presenter leaderboard loading with module-level event codes and local storage keys

### Notes

- this is the routing follow-up to the fifth-scene hub rollout
- the presenter flow can now directly guide players into `智慧灌溉題組` without first going through manual module selection

## v1.9.1

- Date: 2026-04-19
- Branch: `main`
- Title: Add question randomization foundation

### Changes

- added a shared shuffle helper in `app.js`
- randomized answer order for `single-choice`, `timed-choice`, and `image-choice` questions
- randomized initial item order for `ordering` questions
- randomized both left-side prompts and right-side options for `matching` questions
- randomized visible branch-choice order while preserving branch routing logic

### Notes

- this is phase 1 of the planned event-control upgrade

- the main goal of this batch is to reduce fixed-position memorization during repeated play

## v1.9.2

- Date: 2026-04-19
- Branch: `main`
- Title: Strengthen answer-position randomization

### Changes

- upgraded the shuffle helper to avoid repeating the same visible order when possible
- added extra position-avoidance logic for the correct answer in `single-choice`, `timed-choice`, and `image-choice`
- kept `ordering`, `matching`, and `branching` randomization while reducing obvious repeated layouts

### Notes

- this is a tuning pass on top of the original randomization rollout
- the goal is to make answer-position changes feel clearer during real event play

- added a locked-mode fallback message for invalid or missing scene ids
- bumped asset version to `20260419f` and service worker cache version to `v17`

### Notes

- this is phase 3 of the planned event-control upgrade
- presenter / QR routing can now be aligned to locked scene URLs in the next step

## v1.10.2

- Date: 2026-04-19
- Branch: `main`

- rewrote `presenter.js` into a clean scene-aware UTF-8 implementation
- bumped asset version to `20260419g` and service worker cache version to `v18`

### Notes
